# Dataset Information

This project utilizes a dataset that is crucial for training and evaluating various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Linear Regression.

## Dataset Source

The dataset can be sourced from [insert dataset source here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. Ensure to check the licensing and usage terms associated with the dataset.

## Features

The dataset contains the following features:

- **Feature 1**: Description of feature 1.
- **Feature 2**: Description of feature 2.
- **Feature 3**: Description of feature 3.
- **Feature 4**: Description of feature 4.
- **Feature 5**: Description of feature 5.
- **Target Variable**: Description of the target variable.

## Preprocessing Steps

Before training the models, the following preprocessing steps have been applied to the dataset:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were addressed using [insert method, e.g., mean imputation, removal, etc.].
2. **Normalization/Standardization**: The numerical features were normalized/standardized to ensure that they are on a similar scale.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables were encoded using [insert method, e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.].
4. **Splitting the Dataset**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

## Usage

To use this dataset in the project, ensure that it is placed in the appropriate directory and referenced correctly in the code.
